# EasyRTP
Easy to use RTP plugin

# Perfomant
It doesn't do anything fancy or weird like loading chunks, like most RTP plugins do. Which leads it to being performant.

# Installation
* Download the .jar from the Releases tab
* Drop into your `plugins` folder

# Compatibility
I've only tested it on 1.21 but I'm pretty sure it will work on any version. It doesn't use anything special.

# Feature Request
If you have a feature make an issue I will look into it.
