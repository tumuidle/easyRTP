# EasyRTP
Easy to use, straight forward RTP plugin. Performant by design

# Usage
It has two commands:
* `/rtp` teleports you randomly
* `/easyrtp` a link to this repo

And one permission:
* `easyrtp.rtp` for using /rtp

# Installation
* Download the .jar from the Releases tab
* Drop into your `plugins` folder

# Compatibility
I've only tested it on 1.21 but I'm pretty sure it will work on any version. It doesn't use anything special.

# Feature Request
If you have a feature make an issue I will look into it.
